# EdgeAnalytics.xyz

EdgeAnalytics.xyz is an open-source platform for market analysis, algorithmic trading, financial data analysis, and the exploration of machine learning models. Our mission is to provide comprehensive data analysis and foster discussions around data, with the ultimate goal of enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to learn more about finance and its impacts not only on financial markets but also on politics, economics, and other fields.

## DataHub

We have developed an initial version of the platform, which can be accessed at [datahub.edgeanalytics.xyz](http://datahub.edgeanalytics.xyz). The platform is built with Dash by Plotly, fully dockerized, and integrated with CI/CD pipelines. Our goal is to enhance this platform with more features, improve user-friendliness, and make it more robust with a better design.

## Data Analysis

Our primary analyses are available on our website [edgeanalytics.xyz](http://edgeanalytics.xyz). In line with our commitment to open-source methodology, we aim to make our analyses as transparent as possible by releasing all data and code alongside our articles. We strive to provide a reproducible environment to foster open discussions across various fields.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the source code of the platform. Below is a brief description of its organization:

- `data_analysis`: Contains scripts used for data analysis.
- `components`: Contains the components of the platform.
- `datasets`: Contains the datasets used in the platform.
- `graph_objs`: Contains the graph objects used in the platform.
- `scripts`: Contains scripts used for data preprocessing.
- `utils`: Contains utility functions.

Note: While we aim to integrate all our data analyses into the platform, the platform's development takes time. Therefore, we have decided to release the data analyses as a separate folder for a faster release of our methodologies.

## Contributing
